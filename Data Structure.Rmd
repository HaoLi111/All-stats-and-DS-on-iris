## dimension of data

```{r dims}
dim(iris)
```

32 row, 11 columns

 In a tidied data frame
  - each row represents an observation
  - each col a variable

```{r}
colnames(iris)
```

 Print very first rows of the observation
 (including values and names)

```{r}
print(head(iris))
# similarly , tail
print(tail(iris))
```

 You can print explicity with print() function,
 or just leave the variable in the command line
 or wrap the entire command in () to execute
 as the same time, print
```{r}
#e.g. head(iris)
 #e.g.2 (h = head(iris))
```
 The str() function shows the structure of data
 including values and types.

```{r}
str(iris)
```
from which we know all variables are of numeric
type, but not necessarily a continuous var

Is there any missing values?

```{r}
anyNA(iris)
```

Fortunately no.
