# Documentation

Before you start analyzing any datasets, it is helpful to get access to some pre-written information.

Datasets provided by R typically have a very detailed help file.

```
?iris#help(iris)
```

# Background Research

Search with you explorer about the iris data. You may use Wikipedia, Carrot2 or other platforms, but this might help you:

## Search across multiple pages

### browseURL

browseURL() function let you open websites with a default explorer.
For example:

```
browseURL("http://www.r-project.org")
```

### write your own search function

Suppose you want to search with Bing in global mode(in CHN), let us search "Edgar Anderson".

In the text box, type in the key word and you get the following link to.

```
https://cn.bing.com/search?q=Edgar%20Anderson

```

You may get a link longer than this but most would be unecessary.
Now the URL should start with
```
https://cn.bing.com/search?q= + Your Kwd
```

Note that Your keyword maybe preprocessed, in this case a blank space is replaced by "%20".

We can redo this by gsub()

```{r}
kwd = "Edgar Anderson"
gsub(pattern=" ", "%20", kwd, ignore.case = FALSE, perl = FALSE,
     fixed = T, useBytes = FALSE)
```

Now, define a function that turn a kwd into a html that call a Bing search. And run it.

```{r}
searchR_BingCnGlob = function(x) paste0("https://cn.bing.com/search?q=",gsub(pattern=" ", "%20", x, ignore.case = FALSE, perl = FALSE,
     fixed = T, useBytes = FALSE))

searchR_BingCnGlob("iris dataset")
```

Now call browseURL() to open the page.

```
browseURL(searchR_BingCnGlob("iris dataset"))
```

### A cleverer way

This is still tedious, right?

Let's do Wikipedia and Carrot2+PubMed, and then wrap it further.

```
http://search.carrot2.org/stable/search?query=iris+dataset&results=100&source=pubmed&algorithm=lingo&view=foamtree&skin=fancy-compact
```

```{r}
searchR_C2PubMed=function(x) paste0("http://search.carrot2.org/stable/search?query=",gsub(" ","+",x,fixed=T),"&results=100&source=pubmed&algorithm=lingo&view=foamtree&skin=fancy-compact")
```

```{r}
searchR_Wiki = function(x) paste0("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=",gsub(" ","+",x,fixed=T),"&title=Special%3ASearch&go=Go&ns0=1")
```

Then wrap it further.

```{r}

searchR = function(x, engines = c("C2PubMed","Wiki","BingCnGlob"),
                   Operation = browseURL){
  SearchList=list()
  for(i in seq_along(engines)){
    SearchList[[i]] = get(paste("searchR",engines[i],sep="_"))(x)
  }
  lapply(SearchList, Operation)
}
```

And run this.

```
searchR("iris dataset")
```

And Boom! You have all things opened.

## Search multiple objects

We can rewrite the searchR function tolet it take multiple arguments, but this can be done with sapply().

```
sapply(c("iris data",
         "Edgar Anderson",
         "multivariable dataset"),searchR)
```

## Search what the variables are

```
sapply(colnames(iris),searchR)
```

I know this is crazy. Have a good time reading
