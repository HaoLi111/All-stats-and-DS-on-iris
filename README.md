# All-stats-and-DS-on-iris
A collection of ALL POSSIBLE statistical and data science models on the iris data set in R. Let us make a comparision between ALL invented approaches to crunch the data!

README

This is a repository to store and share ALL THINGS that can be done with the famous iris dataset in R.

Follow this project to see how one (non-time-serial) dataset can be explored, analyzed, visualized and explained in a number of ways.

There is no one way to 'correctly' help us understand data. Understand different method can be inspirational. Also, the use of R and a variety of R packages can be demonstrated in this way.


The different perspectives include:
## 0 Before you start
 - Prerequisites
 - Accessing Data Background Info(a fast way)
## 1 Basic statistics
